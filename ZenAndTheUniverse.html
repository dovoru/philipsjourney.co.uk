          <p class="style17">The cosmologists tell me that if I look  outwards in space I look backwards in time.   So the beginning of time is the outermost shell of the universe I observe.  Not only has that, but the further out I  look, the slower time run.  So time  spreads outwards in space like ripples on the surface of a pool after a stone  has entered the water.  The wavelength of  the ripples gets longer the further they are from the centre.  The wavelength of time gets longer the  further away it is from the centre.  If I  look across to the person walking on the other side of the road, they are  behind me in time.  Not only that, but  their watch runs slower than mine.  Conversely,  if they look across to me, I am behind them in time and my watch runs slower  than theirs.  That is not logical, it is a  mystery.  Time is a great mystery; St Augustine said he knew  what it was until someone asked him about it.   A mystery can be known, but it cannot be told by one person to another.  This kind of knowledge comes from within and  can only be known directly.</p>
          <p class="style17">At the scale of people on opposite sides of  the road, this curious phenomenon is imperceptible.  But the phenomenon is so real that the GPS  system has to make a daily correction for it.   Time in the satellites is behind and runs slower than time on earth, and  time on earth is behind and runs slower than time in the satellites. If a daily  correction were not made, the coordinates given by GPS would slowly drift and  the system would become useless.  So time  in the universe is not absolute; it is relative to the observer.  The universe I see is relative to me.  I seem to be the centre of the universe.  </p>
          <p class="style17">The realisation that everything is relative  was the great discovery of the 20th Century, not only in cosmology  but also in the person centred therapies pioneered by Carl Rogers.  These therapies are based on the art of  empathy.  Empathy is the ability to be  real and to see the world though another person’s eyes at the same time.  In therapy, if the therapist is real, this  process makes it easy for the client to become real.  When that happens, both realise that each  sees reality differently, but there is only one reality.  In an empathic relationship a reality can be  seen that is beyond the reality either person can see on their own.  Our ability to perceive reality depends on our  ability to be real and on the quality of our relationships with one another.</p>
          <p class="style17">The realisation that everything is relative  poses a huge challenge for Christianity. In the time of Ptolemy the centre of  the known universe was the earth.  By the  time of Galileo the centre of the known universe had shifted to the sun.  This shift was such a challenge to  Christianity that it took the hierarchy of my own Church until 1996 for to  formally acknowledge the work of Galileo.   By that time, the next shift had already taken place.  And this shift is even more challenging.  We have discovered that the centre of the  known universe is not a physical place, it is within the knower.  That means that the centre of the known  universe is subjective.  It is these  discoveries that have given rise to the intellectual free for all of post  modernism.  Is there anything beyond post  modernism?  I believe there is.</p>
          <p class="style17">If I turn my back on the outer universe in  which I live, and look deep within my own heart, I am looking forward in  time.  The future is within me; the way  ahead is the way within.  The world  within and the world without are like reflections in a mirror.  Outwardly the universe is expanding in space,  I am looking backwards in time, and time is slowing down.  Inwardly space is contracting, I am looking  forwards in time, and time is speeding up.   The end of time is the centre, the tiny point of nothingness where the  time that divides disappears and things happen in no time at all.  This tiny point of nothingness at the end of  time is the tiny point of nothingness from which the universe emerged in the  beginning.  It is the point at which the  universe is continually being renewed.   This is the mystery at the centre of everyone of which the mystics  speak.  It is the mystery at the end of  time.</p>
          <p class="style17">My most intense experience of the end of  time occurred on a Christian/Buddhist retreat at Turvey Abbey in 2006.  I have had close encounters before and since  but that particular encounter was a direct hit. In the days leading up to the  retreat I had been feeling particularly fragmented.  Events in the day did not seem to be  connecting up.  Driving to Turvey I got  lost three times, which is very unusual for me; I usually have an excellent  sense of direction.  We spent most of the  weekend in silence contemplating the beatitude: ‘Blessed&nbsp;are the poor in  spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.’   Matt 5.3:  On the first evening we  gathered in a circle to introduce ourselves.   When it was my turn to speak, I didn’t know what to say.  While I was sitting there not knowing what to  say about myself, I was surprised to hear myself speak.  I spoke of the call of Christ and the  presence of Christ in my life.  The call  is a call to be one with a presence that is always present.  Normally I know what I am going to say before  I speak, but this time I spoke before I knew what I was going to say.  Normally I see things coming before they  arrive, but this time something arrived before I saw it coming.  Imagine I could approach you faster than the  speed of light, I would be with you before you saw me coming.  It was like that.  The normal sequence of events seemed to  reverse.  Then something strange  happened.  I seemed to stumble across and fall through a gap  in time. In the gap nothing existed but God.  Even I did not exist, I disappeared into  God.  Everything that exists seemed to implode  into the gap and disappear into God.   Even time disappeared into God.  It  was the end of time, but not in the conventional sense.  Then everyting exploded out the other side and  began again.  And time began again.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Danger,  Intelligent Designer at work</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">I sometimes think the universe should  contain a giant sign saying “Danger, Intelligent Designer at work” I see the  universe as a work of intelligent design in the way that the internet is a work  of intelligent design.  Both are work in  progress.  The intelligence that is  designing the internet is beyond the intelligence of a single individual.  It is collective intelligence distributed  throughout a community of tens of thousands of people all round the globe  thinking together.  No single person is  in control; the cooperation is instinctive, like the flock behaviour of  starlings.  We humans are flock animals  with flock instincts.  In the same way  the intelligence that is designing the universe is distributed throughout the  universe.  This is divine  intelligence.  There is no  super-intelligent designer outside the universe.  The intelligent designer pervades the  universe and is working from the inside out.   The intelligent designer is inside each one of us and works through  us.  We humans are invited to play a  small part in this great act of creation.  We are invited to collaborate with the cosmic  creative process.</p>
           <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Philip’s Sharing  November 2008</strong></h2>
        
            <p class="style17">This is an expansion of the sharing I sent by email yesterday.  Looking back over 2008 I see five trends that  all emanate from what happened to me on the Christian Buddhist retreat at  Turvey Abbey in 2006.  On that retreat I  seemed to stumble across and fall through a gap in time.  In the gap nothing existed but God.  Even I was not there – I ceased to exist and  then began again.  It was a new beginning.  Everything that exists in time imploded into  the gap then exploded out the other side.   It was the end of time, but not in the conventional sense.  No-one has ever seen time, but we can imagine  it.  And there are many different ways of  imagining time.  In Western Culture we  are addicted to one particular way of imagining time.  We are linear thinkers and we imagine time in  a linear way, as if it were the horizontal axis of a simple Cartesian  coordinate system.  The end of time is  the end of the line.  At the end of time  there is no future, but there is a past.   The end of time to which I refer was more profound than that.  Not only was there no future, but there was  also no past.  The whole of time  disappeared and then began again.  It was  a new beginning.  Eckhart Tolle says of  the gap in time:  “Nothing truly new and  creative can come into this world except through that gap, that clear space of  infinite possibility.”  This is the  origin of the universe, the centre of the big bang, where time itself is always  beginning.  The gap into which time  disappears at the end of time is the gap from which time emerges in the beginning.  And the gap is now.<br />
            Looking back over my life in 2008 I see these five trends:</p>
            <ul>
            <li class="style17"><strong>The older I grow the more I enjoy life.</strong>  The closer I come to death, the more I love  life. </li>
            <li class="style17"><strong>The less I do the more happens.</strong>  I work part time as a counselor and supervisor  and in the work I seem to increasingly just sit and watch miracles unfold  before my eyes.  It is not my doing, but  I am allowing it to happen.  Healing is a  natural process that happens all by itself.   The paradox is that if I try to make it happen, I sabotage it.  My role is to be present and give permission  to a natural process.  We live in a  culture that is addicted to the notion of cause and effect.  Without a cause, nothing would happen.  But this is not true.  Things are happening all by themselves all  the time.  Trying to make things happen,  or change things, blinds us to this natural process and actually impedes it.</li>
            <li class="style17"><strong>Serendipity is increasing.</strong>  There are more happy coincidences.  Things are connecting up.  Here is an example.  In September Philomena and I went on holiday  to the Cotswolds.  The landlady, Margery,  was a woman in her late 70s.  She asked  us how long we had lived in Chandlers Ford.   When we said since 1960 her eyes lit up and she asked if we knew anyone  named Marilyn.  There are about 20,000  people living in Chandlers Ford, but Philomena had worked in a charity shop  with a woman named Marilyn.  It turned  out to be the right person.  They had  been in teacher training college together in London and had lost touch when  they left college.  All Margery knew was  that Marilyn had moved to Chandlers Ford.    They are now back in touch and planning to go for a meal and to the  theatre together.</li>
            <li class="style17"><strong>The religion that was handed down to me as a child  seems increasingly like a cruel hoax.</strong>   It is not just nonsense, it is cruel nonsense.  Looking back on my life from the age of 74 I  increasingly see it as a string of blessings.   Conception is the original blessing, death is the final blessing, and  now is the present blessing.  In reality  it is always now so we are permanently blessed.   My childhood religion did not teach me about the present blessing.  It was a fear motivated religion.  It taught me about original sin and final  judgment.  It taught me to fear the end  of time, that at the end of time is a great divide.  But my experience at Turvey showed me that at  the end of time is a great communion, all ends in God.  All is consumed by the God from whom all  originates in the beginning.  All begins  in love and ends in love.  There is  nothing for anyone to fear at the end of time.</li>
            <li class="style17"><strong>The Good News is increasingly self evident.</strong>  I look at the world with all its’ failings  and I see good news, I see the kingdom coming, I see the Lord answering the  Lord’s Prayer, I see the Lord doing the Lord’s will.  This is not our doing, it is beyond us.  It is the Lord’s doing, and it is wonderful  to see.  So I think this is how Jesus saw  the world.  I think he looked at the  world with all its’ failings and saw good news, he saw the kingdom coming.  The vision of Jesus is not the vision of  another world; it is another way of seeing this world.  The way of Jesus is not the way to another  world, it is another way of living in this world.  We are not going to the kingdom; the kingdom  is coming to us.  And it is coming to us  where we are here now.  This is why we  have to remain in the here and now.   Otherwise we will miss it.</li>
            
            <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>A Core Group Sharing</strong> <br />
            </h2>
            <p class="style17">At  the Core Group meeting last Monday Janice invited me to write something on what  I had shared.  Bearing in mind that the  original meaning of what is spoken only exists at the time of speaking and  cannot be repeated, what I said was something like this:</p>
            <p class="style17">In  recent months I have started to feel as if I have arrived at the end of the  journey, which is also the beginning.  I  seem to have arrived at the still centre of the universe, the centre of balance  of all things.  The universe seems to be  in process of expanding or unfolding outwards from within.  Space/time seems to be expanding outwards  from here/now.  I have a sense of the  universe as a single self balancing system and here/now is the centre of  balance.  The universe also seems to be  self correcting and self healing.  </p>
            <p class="style17">A  world with a single centre of power is unbalanced, all power needs a  counterbalance.  The world became  unstable when the Soviet Union collapsed and  we were left with one super power.  The  system is unstable now but it will naturally correct itself.  Whoever exalts themselves is humbled, and  whoever humbles themselves is exalted.   This is not to reverse the positions which is no better than before; it  is to restore balance.  I am absolutely  certain that ultimately all will be well for all of us.</p>
            <p class="style17">I  have a growing sense that the Creator is within me.  Therefore if I lost the whole of creation it  would not matter because it could be created all over again from within.  Later Gillian asked me how I came to this  sense.  It came as a result of going  through a crisis in a personal relationship during which I experienced what  seems to be my fear of extinction.  I wanted to be but it was impossible to  be.  This led to a feeling of dread that  lasted for several hours.  </p>
            <span class="style17">Nothing seemed able  to shift it.  I could not concentrate on  anything.  I tried relaxing, meditating,  going for a walk but nothing would shift the feeling of dread.  The image that came up was of my life as a  flickering candle flame.  If it blew out  there would be no-one left to re-light it.   The fear was not of my own extinction, but of the extinction of the  source of my life.  It was after this  that I started to feel as if the source of
            my  life was within me and is inseparable from me.   This source is the source of all life in the universe and is the creator  acting from within creation.            </span>
            <p class="style17">I  have also come to a new experience of time.   The traditional way of thinking about time is that it is a finite  straight line with a beginning and an end.   We are travelling through time from the beginning to the end.  The past is getting longer and the future is  getting shorter.  Time is a finite  resource that we are using up.  Time can  be divided into abutting segments; years, days, hours, minutes etc.  Now is the smallest segment of time (an atom  of time) and we live life one moment at time, passing from one moment to the  next.  That is how I used to experience  time.  The way I experience time now is  very different.  <br />
              Imagine  that you took the ends of linear time, folded them round so that they joined  up.  The line becomes a circle.  Imagine that now is the beginning and end of  the circle.  Now is not a piece of time,  it is an infinitely small gap in the circle of time.  Now is after the end of past time and before  the beginning of future time.  The past  is complete and the future has not yet begun.   Now I am free from past and future.  </p>
            <p class="style17">Now  I am free to imagine alternative futures and alternative pasts.  Now is the centre of balance of past and  future.  That is, past and future are  like reflections in a mirror.  If I want  to imagine an alternative future, I also have to imagine an alternative  past.  This is why forgiveness is  necessary for growth.  Forgiving is  imagining an alternative past so that an alternative future can begin.  Time is not a finite resource, it is  expanding outwards from now.  Past and  future are both increasing.  The supply  is limitless.</p>
            <p class="style17">Past  and future are like reflections in a mirror.   The fall and the last judgement are reflections of each other (this is  where Adrian  started to shake his head).  The fall is  when we start to judge, when we first attempt to separate good from evil, the  guilty from the innocent; when we start to blame others and to feel shame  ourselves.  It is the beginning of  dualism.  The last judgement is the last  time that we attempt this division.  The  last judgement is the one in which we find the whole of creation innocent.  We start in the garden and end in the  garden.  We are back at the beginning,  but things are not the same.  When we  return to the beginning we are different and the garden is different.  And all this is happening now.</p>
