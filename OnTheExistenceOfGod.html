          <p class="style17">When I was a child I believed in the  existence of God.  I was 12 when it first  occurred to me that God might not exist.   It was a brief thought, and then it was gone.  But it came as a shock.  I recall clearly that I was walking beside a  pool with my older brother at the time.   I did not tell anyone.  In the  sixth form at grammar school I studied Apologetics and Catholic Doctrine –  proving that the doctrines of the Church are true.  When it came to the five classical proofs of  the existence of God, they cut no ice with me.   There was something phony about the whole process.  If I know God, then proving the existence of  God is as pointless as proving the existence of my wife.  If I don’t know God, then I have no idea who  or what it is I am trying to prove the existence of.  This is also a pointless exercise.  And so trying to prove the existence of God is  always a pointless exercise; it will get you nowhere.</p>
          <p class="style17">So does God exist or not?  The answer is both yes and no depending on  what you mean by God.  My simplest  definition of God is:  God is love.  How do you prove that love exists?  How do I know that you love me?  How do you know that I love you?  How do we know that God loves us?  How does God know that we love God?   One thing Jesus said is that the world will  know that God loves them if we love one another as God loves us.  That means if we keep the second commandment  of Jesus; to love one another as equals.   If we love one another as equals, then we love one another as God loves  us because God has no favourites.  That  is how we reveal the father’s love in the world.  And that is an enormous challenge for the Christian Churches.  Instead of keeping one another at a distance,  people from different Churches would have to love one another as equals.  There would be no hierarchy among the  Churches.  We would see that no Church  was any better or any worse than any other Church.  Denominational identity would cease to  matter.</p>
