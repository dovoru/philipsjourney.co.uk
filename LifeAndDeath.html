        <td bordercolor="#00008F"><h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>The  Process of Life</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">I see life as a continuous learning  process.  I learn how to live in the  process of living.  The learning is  lifelong and continues until the end.   There is something unknown waiting to be discovered until the journey is  complete.  And so the journey of life is  like a Who-Done-it?  There is an  unfolding mystery that is only fully revealed on the last page.  Life is full of mystery until the very end.</p>
          <p class="style17">Life is a natural process that happens all  by itself.  The process can be trusted;  it knows what it is about.  The process  teaches us how life is to be lived.  It  is a cyclic process revealed in the cycles in nature; life ebbs and flows.  The dying of the old and the rising of the  new are phases in a cycle of life. Life is continually being renewed. The ups  and downs, highs and lows we experience in life are part of the natural flow of  life.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Life  after Death</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">Philomena and I have been part of one  another’s lives since the age of two.    We have lived through heaven and hell together many times over the  years.  Our lives are like two strands  woven together into one thread over a lifetime.   When I go the thread will end.  Philomena will need to grieve, then move on;  begin a new life as a single strand.   That is life after death.  Concern  for life after death is concern for the life that continues here on earth after  I have gone.  Initially it is concern for  the future lives of those most affected by my going.  Ultimately it is concern for the future of  that whole delicate web of life here on earth of which human life is just one  strand.</p>
         
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Help  and Helplessness</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">When I worked as a counsellor every client  came with different needs.  Sometimes a  client would come who was facing overwhelming adversity in life.  They had reached the very limit of what they  could bear.  They could not go on any longer.  As I sat listening to their story I would  feel increasingly helpless to help.  When  I felt utterly helpless, something would shift.   Help came.  Helpful words came to  me.  </p>
          <p class="style17">My disease is making me increasingly  helpless.  When I face the final helplessness  of death, will help come to me?  Have I  got that much faith?</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Possessions</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">My life is not my life, it doesn’t belong  to me.  It belongs to God.  It came from God in the beginning, and it  returns to God in the end.  It was freely  given to me in the beginning.  I did not  earn it and I do not deserve it.  I can  accept it, but I have no right to keep it.   I cannot possess it: it is not my possession.  It belongs to God and to God it must return.  The same is true of everything.  None of  my possessions belong to me; they belong to God and must return to God in the  end.  In reality I have no possessions,  not even a soul.  This is good news  because it means I have nothing to lose, not even a soul.</p>
