          <p class="style17">&nbsp;I have been actively engaged in the  search for Christian unity locally from 1992 to 2010. &nbsp;It has been a time  of both challenge and reward. &nbsp;I have come to think of myself as part of  the local Christian community, which for me is more than being a Roman  Catholic. &nbsp;Christians together are more than Christians apart. &nbsp;I  have particularly valued the support of the local Christian community in times  of crisis. &nbsp;When a much loved parish priest left unexpectedly to get  married, and the reporters were hovering round the church doors eager for  scraps of gossip to publish, my parish was thrown into crisis. &nbsp;The wider  Christian community gathered round in support. &nbsp;When I was a child that  would have been unthinkable; in those days the other Churches would have  gathered round to gloat. &nbsp;That is how far things have changed in my life  time. &nbsp;Sometimes the journey seems painfully slow, but I think that is due  to our impatience. &nbsp;In this work you need to be willing to wait till the  end of time. &nbsp;And that takes a lot of patience.  </p>
          <p class="style17">The perfect unity to which we are called  exists at the end of time, which is when the kingdom comes, which is when God  comes.  If we are willing to wait, it  will be given to us in God’s good time.  This  unity, this kingdom, is a gift freely offered that can be freely received. If  we are impatient and try to make it come in our time, by our own efforts, we  will be frustrated.  In addition this  gift cannot be possessed.  It does not  belong to us; it is God’s gift to the whole world, that the world may be one  with God.  If we try to possess it we  lose it.</p>
          <p class="style17">This journey has turned my Christian faith  upside down.  In the beginning I thought  of myself as a Roman Catholic in the Roman Catholic Church.  There were Anglicans in the Anglican Church,  Methodists in the Methodist   Church and so on.  Christians were divided into Churches; our  Churches kept us apart.  At the end of  the journey I think of myself as a Christian in the Roman Catholic Church.  There are Christians in all the Churches, and  beyond.  Christians form an invisible  network that transcends Church boundaries and unites the Churches.  This journey took me through a profound  crisis of faith which changed my sense of identity; my sense of belonging.  The crisis was triggered by a publication of  the Catholic Bishops conference.</p>
          <p class="style17">In 1998 the Roman  Catholic Bishops of the United    Kingdom published <em>One Bread One Body</em>; a teaching document on the Eucharist.  The hierarchy had become increasingly  concerned at Roman Catholics sharing the Eucharist with other Christians.  The teaching on the Eucharist and the rules  about sharing it are at the very heart of our identity as Roman Catholics.  To question this teaching threatens our very identity.  The document was an attempt to put the brakes  on sharing the Eucharist with other Christians.   I had just been on pilgrimage to Taizé with the local United Reformed  Church where I had spent a week sharing the Eucharist daily with thousands of  people from different Churches all round the world.  I came back with a song in my heart and a  spring in my step.  Two weeks later I  took part in a diocesan conferenceon<em> One Bread One Body</em>.  The doctrine in the book and the reality I  had experienced in Taizé seemed to be totally divorced.  I felt a deep sense of despair in the  hierarchy of my Church.  I could not in  clear conscience accept the teaching of my own bishops.  It seemed that I must leave my Church.</p>
          <p class="style17">This brought up very  deep questions and anxieties.  I wrestled  with these anxieties for a whole year.  I  had commited myself to following the call of Christ in my life.  Was Christ calling me to leave my  Church?  Then I went on pilgrimage to Iona with the local Methodists and reached a decision  point.  I disagreed with a doctrine that  was at the very heart of my own Church and that defined Roman Catholic  identity.  In which case I could no  longer in good conscience say that I was a Roman Catholic.   This felt like a deep loss of identity, as  if I had discovered at the age of 66 that I had been adopted at birth and that  the people I had thought of all my life as my parents were not my real  parents.  My real parents were unknown to  me.    My real identity was unknown.  On the other hand it had become clear to me  that Christ was not calling me to belong to any other Church.  Christ seemed to be calling me to live with  no Church identity.  Christ was calling  me to be a Christian.  As a Christian I  see myself as a child of the one heavenly father, and our father has no  favourites.  He loves us all equally.  In the father’s eyes there is no hierarchy  among his children.  It is no better to  belong to one Church than another.  In our  father’s eyes denominational identity is irrelevant.  He loves us all equally.</p>
          <p class="style17">&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17">Turvey Abbey 2006</h2>
          <p class="style17">Philomena and I have just returned from a  weekend retreat at Turvey Abbey near Bedford.  It was an intense retreat and I was surprised  at a number of insights that came up for me.   One related to the search for Christian unity and I would like to share  it with you while it is still fresh and clear and before it begins to  fade.  The theme of the retreat was the  beatitude “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of  heaven.” (Matt 5:3).  The retreat was  held in silence punctuated by several sessions of Lectio Divina.  This combination of silence and depth created  an intense experience for everyone.   There was no opportunity to indulge in the comfort of chatter and  “talking about” things.</p>
          <p class="style17">The retreat was very effectively  facilitated jointly by George Wilson, a lay Buddhist, and Sr. Lucy, a Christian  Benedictine nun.  The material that we  used for Lectio Divina was a sermon on this beatitude by the Christian mystic  Meister Eckhart, and a Buddhist response to that sermon written by George  Wilson.  The response drew parallels  between Christian and Buddhist mystical insights.  </p>
          <p class="style17">Caveat:   In what follows I make dogmatic statements, I sermonise.  This can seem arrogant and get up peoples’  noses.  I write this way for brevity.  Before every dogmatic statement you can  assume a hidden “From my particular point of view at this particular point in  time, it seems to me as if ...” I take it for granted that I can never see  reality as it is.  I can only see reality  from my particular point of view at this particular point in time.  To see reality as it is I would have to be  able to see from all possible points of view at every point in time  simultaneously.  I would have to be able  to see through the eyes of every person, past present and future, at every  point it time simultaneously.  Only God  can see in that way, and I am not God.   Although God is in me and does look out through my eyes.  I do get a glimpse of reality.</p>
          <p class="style17">The first thing that came up for me and  surprised me on the retreat was to realise with unusual clarity that the end of  the search for Christian Unity is not Christian unity.  I sort of knew this before, but it suddenly  became crystal clear.  Christian unity is  merely the beginning of the search.  I  wonder if this is what Jesus meant when he prayed that we may all be one <em>so that the world may believe</em>.  A believing world transcends Christian  unity.  If we imagine Christian unity to  be the end of the search, we will inevitably fail.  We will have given up before we have even  begun.  We will be missing the whole  transcendent dimension of the search.</p>
          <p class="style17">Ultimately there is only one unity.  All searches for unity have this same  ultimate destiny; a unity that is beyond all unities.  The Christian search for unity and the  scientific search for unity have the same ultimate end.  The scientific search for a unified theory of  everything does not end in a unified theory of everything.  That is merely the beginning.  For me the ultimate end of all searches for  unity is what Jesus called the kingdom of heaven.  He left us a rich store of metaphors to show  us the way to the kingdom and some to warn us when we are going in the wrong  direction.  The beatitudes crystallise  this vision for me.  The kingdom of heaven  is like a world in which the beatitudes have come true.  This is a paradoxical world in which the poor  are rich and the rich are poor.</p>
          <p class="style17">Even time itself shares in the  paradoxical nature of the kingdom.  The  end of time and the beginning of time become one.  I think this is how the early disciples  experienced time.  It seemed as if they  were at the end of time and the beginning of a new creation.  They were beginning to experience living in  the kingdom.  When we finally reach the  kingdom we will realise that we are back in the garden where it all began.  The gate through which we enter the kingdom  is the same gate through which we left the garden.  Only this time we will be in the garden by  choice rather than chance and fully awake rather than as in a dream.  The dream we have all dreamed from the  beginning will have come true.  God’s  dream for creation will have come true through us and in us. </p>
          <p class="style17">Somewhere along the way we Christians  lost sight of the transcendent dimension of the kingdom.  Our vision got truncated in the Church.  We mistook the Church for the end and lost  sight of the fact the end of the Church is the beginning of the kingdom.  I think that Christians began to lose the  experience of living in the kingdom when logic became king of Christian  thinking.  In the kingdom of logic things  exist in themselves.  A thing is what it  is and is not what it is not.  In the  kingdom of paradox, nothing exists in itself.   A thing is one with what it is not.   Catholics are one with non Catholics.   Christians are one with non Christians.   God is one with what is not God.   An extreme is one with its opposite.   The rich and the poor become one, both materially and spiritually.  The supreme spirit becomes one with the  humblest spirit.  For Roman Catholics of  my vintage, the God I was taught to believe in as a child - the supreme Spirit  who alone exists of himself - is no more.   God and I are one, although I am not God and God is not me.</p>
          <p class="style17">Logic ends in division.  Logic divides this from that, right from  wrong and so on.  Paradox ends in  union.  Paradox reconciles what logic has  divided.  Logic is quick to divide,  paradox is slow to heal.  Christianity  today needs an infusion of paradoxical thinking.  We need people who are slow to judge; people  who can hold opposing points of view together long enough for healing to  begin.  I am reminded once again of the  words with which Pope John announced the second Vatican  council:  “We will not try to find out  who was wrong, we will not try to find out who was right, we will only say: let  us be reconciled!” </p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>In  Praise of the Margins</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">The world’s religions hold much in  common.  Love is central to every major  religion.  What is distinctive to my  personal faith as a Christian, what makes me Christian rather than Muslim, or  Hindu, or Buddhist, is the call of Christ and the presence of Christ in my  life.  Christ is always present to me,  and Christ calls me to be one with him.   I first heard this call about 18 years ago, shortly after I became  engaged in the search for Christian unity.   I noticed that when Christians from different Churches came together in  a spirit of prayer to seek unity, Christ seemed to be present in a special  way.  Christ was more fully present to me  than in the Mass of my own RC Church.</p>
          <p class="style17">I expected the call of Christ in my life to  lead me in towards the centre of my own Church.   I expected to become more one with Rome.   But the opposite happened.  Christ  seemed to calling me out of my Church.   Then I noticed that I began coming into conflict with members of my own  Church.  There seemed to be a polarisation  under way in which some were being drawn outwards, while others were being  drawn inwards towards Rome.  And we kept  colliding.  A crisis came when I lost my  temper with my own parish priest in a Churches Together meeting.  A second crisis came when the Bishops of the United Kingdom published <em>One Bread One Body</em>; a teaching document  on sharing the Eucharist with Christians of other Churches.  I had spent a week in Taizé sharing the  Eucharist daily with thousands of people from different Churches all round the  world.  I came back with a song in my  heart and a spring in my step.  Two weeks  later I took part in a diocesan conferenceon<em> One Bread One Body</em>.  The doctrine in the book and the reality I  had experienced in Taizé seemed to be totally divorced.  I felt a deep sense of despair in the  hierarchy of my Church.  It seemed that I  must leave my Church.</p>
          <p class="style17">I spent a year agonising over whether  Christ was calling me to leave my Church.   It became clear that Christ was not calling me into another Church.  Christ seemed to be calling me to live on the  margins, with no Church identity.  What I  have learned from this experience is that the centre is not Rome, nor  Canterbury, nor Jerusalem.  The centre is  not a geographical place. The centre is in my own heart.  The centre is where God is at home.  Christ was drawing me home to God.</p>
          <p class="style17">&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17">Letter to Paul</h2>
          <p class="style17">Dear Paul,</p>
          <p class="style17">Thank you for your booklet.  I think it was important to write this  story.  The first thing that struck me  was the amount of sheer hard work you have put in which was poorly rewarded and  largely taken for granted. </p>
          <p class="style17">The second thing that struck me was the  contrast between the many frustrations and the profound experiences.  I think anyone who takes on the burden of  working for unity shares the burden of the cross with Jesus.  And don’t forget it was religious people who  gave Jesus the hardest time.  And it was  religious people who plotted and planned to get Jesus crucified.  Religion is not all sweetness and light; we  mess with it at our peril.  But sharing  the burden of the cross with Jesus is the price we pay for the profound  experiences that are a privilege we never forget – glimpses of the possibility  of the kingdom.</p>
          <p class="style17">Another thing that struck me was how Churches  tend to see unity as Church unity.  I  think the call to be one is far deeper and wider than that.  I am with Basil Hume in seeing the first step  for each person as the search for unity in the depths of their own heart; being  one with the God who is closer to me than I am to myself; with the God who  makes his home in the depths of my heart.   The last step is to reach out and include the whole cosmos.  The closer I come to the God within, the  wider my embrace of the cosmos.</p>
          <p class="style17">On mission and unity I find Bishop Crispian’s  terms mission and communion helpful. This is how I see it.  Mission and communion are two sides of the same  coin.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a communion with a mission, and our mission is  communion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mission is to take communion out into the world; to transform  the fragmented multicultural world in which we live into a communion of  love.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that the world is not a communion of love, our  mission is incomplete.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that our mission is incomplete,  our communion is incomplete.&nbsp;Our mission will be complete when we are  completely one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
&nbsp;It is the father’s love for us that gathers us together in communion; it  is the father’s love for the world that sends us out in mission to the  world.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we gather together round the father’s table on Sunday, we  deepen our roots in the father’s love.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go out in mission to  the world from Monday to Saturday, we take the father’s love out into the  world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeper our roots; the wider our mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is the simple mission we carry out in the small details of our ordinary  everyday lives.&nbsp; At the deepest level it is the father’s love for me that  gathers me into communion with him. It is the father’s love for the world that  sends me out in mission to the world.   When our mission is complete the kingdom will come.  That is the final communion when creator and  creation are completely one.  </p>
          <p class="style17">On a subtle point I noticed a tendency to  hierarchical thinking in CTHI.  IBM went  through a crisis in 1970.  The 60s were  the golden age of hierarchical information systems and we were the undisputed  world leader.  The sky was blue, the sun  was shining and money was falling from heaven.   In 1970 the train hit the buffers.   We had reached the end of the golden age.  We are now in the golden age of relational  systems like the internet.  The  transition for designers required a change in the language of thinking. A  system is a network of functions in relationship.  We had been designing the functions first and  the relationships second.  That is an  aspect of hierarchical thinking.  We had  to begin thinking relationally.  Then you  design the relationships first and the functions second.  In designing a human system this means  designing the network of relationships first and the roles or job specification  second.  The same principle applies in  counselling – the first thing is to build a working relationship with the  client.  Then the work can begin.  In CTHI we tended to spend more time on role  specification than on relationship specification.  Another symptom of hierarchical thinking is  to mistake a part for the whole; to mistake the governing body of a Church for  the Church as a whole.  The RC Church is  a prime example.  In CTHI we tended to refer  to the central body as CTHI which I think is confusing.  It would be clearer to reserve CTHI for the  Churches Together in the area as a whole.</p>
          <p class="style17">For my part I want to thank you for  inviting me to join you on this part of your journey.  My share of the burden was light and I met  many interesting people and got many new insights.  It was part of my journey too.  And we became friends which I really value.                               Philip 23 Aug  2010<br />
  Regarding my comments  on your booklet it was now or never. &nbsp;If I had left it the booklet would  have disappeared into my pile of &quot;things to do&quot; to be lost forever.  &nbsp;In the case of the chocolates a different principle was at work. &nbsp;I  have another two comments on DEOs and on Covenants.</p>
          <p class="style17">The DEOs say there is  not enough time to devote to CTHI because of their denominational/diocesan  responsibilities. &nbsp;There is always enough time do do what is most  important. &nbsp;A shortage of time indicates a low priority. &nbsp;The problem  is that Churches tend to prioritise the internal working of their own Church  above working together with other Churches.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style17">A covenant is a  commitment to work together. &nbsp;Difficulties in forming covenants shows a  lack of commitment to working together. &nbsp;I see Churches Together as  Churches working together for the common good. Churches put aside their  individual self interest in favour of the common good. &nbsp;This is Churches  working together for the coming of the kingdom, which does not belong to the  Churches. &nbsp;It is God's gift to the world.</p>
          <p class="style17">I too saw a grown man  cry at Swanwick. &nbsp;&nbsp;I think he was a Methodist and&nbsp;It was  &nbsp;huge shock. . &nbsp;It was the day of the Roman Catholic Mass. &nbsp;The  notes for the service said &quot;Roman Catholic discipline forbids the sharing  of the Eucharist with members of other Churches, but you are welcome to come  for a blessing.&quot;. &nbsp;On occasions like that, when Christians have formed  a communion of love, to forbid people to share the eucharist is a  contradiction. &nbsp;It destroys communion.</p>
