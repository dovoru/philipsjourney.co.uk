          <p class="style17">I am passing through a time of great  affliction.  I am visibly dying and I  don’t want to die.  Each Thursday In June  I drove into Winchester, climbed the stairs of the Olive Branch Christian  Counselling Service, and supervised a group of counsellors.  I loved the work.  It was incredibly rewarding to see the  counsellors growing in competence and to see the healing and nourishing taking  place in their client’s lives.  By the  end of August everything had changed.  The  car was gathering dust in the garage, and rather than climbing stairs I was  struggling to stand upright holding onto a frame.  The subtlety of the therapeutic conversation  had been replaced by typing with one finger of my left hand on a Lightwriter  which gives me an artificial voice.  I am  dying and I don’t want to die.  I enjoy  life here on earth and I don’t want to leave.   I love my wife, my home, my family and my friends and I don’t want to  leave them.  Philomena and I are being  torn apart after a lifetime shared together.   Can comfort be found in all this affliction? </p>
          <p class="style17">What is most comforting is to know that I  am not alone.  The main lesson life seems  to be teaching me at present is that I am not alone; I have never been alone  and will never be alone.  Even death does  not separate me from other people.  We  are one in death as we are one in life.   We live together and we die together.   Life and death are two things that we all share in common. To me it  seems as if there is only one life that we all share.  There is no such thing as an individual  life.  My life and your life are two  sides of the same life.  Death is where  my life ends and yours begins; where your life ends and mine begins.  I can’t live your life and you can’t live my  life.  The life we live together, the  life we share in common, is greater than the sum of the lives we live  separately.  This is what comforts me  most in my time of affliction; to know that my life is part of a greater whole.  And the whole is greater than the sum of the  parts.</p>
