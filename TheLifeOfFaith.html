          <p class="style17">I see life as a continuous learning  process.  I learn how to live in the  process of living.  The learning is  lifelong and continues until the end.   There is something unknown waiting to be discovered until the journey is  complete.  And so the journey of life is  like a Who-Done-it?  There is an  unfolding mystery that is only fully revealed on the last page.  Life is full of mystery until the very end.</p>
          <p class="style17">Life is a natural process that happens all  by itself.  The process can be trusted;  it knows what it is about.  The process  teaches us how life is to be lived.  It  is a cyclic process revealed in the cycles in nature; life ebbs and flows.  The dying of the old and the rising of the  new are phases in a cycle of life. Life is continually being renewed. The ups  and downs, highs and lows we experience in life are part of the natural flow of  life.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Life  after Death</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">Philomena and I have been part of one  another’s lives since the age of two.    We have lived through heaven and hell together many times over the  years.  Our lives are like two strands  woven together into one thread over a lifetime.   When I go the thread will end.  Philomena will need to grieve, then move on;  begin a new life as a single strand.   That is life after death.  Concern  for life after death is concern for the life that continues here on earth after  I have gone.  Initially it is concern for  the future lives of those most affected by my going.  Ultimately it is concern for the future of  that whole delicate web of life here on earth of which human life is just one  strand.</p>
         
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Help  and Helplessness</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">When I worked as a counsellor every client  came with different needs.  Sometimes a  client would come who was facing overwhelming adversity in life.  They had reached the very limit of what they  could bear.  They could not go on any longer.  As I sat listening to their story I would  feel increasingly helpless to help.  When  I felt utterly helpless, something would shift.   Help came.  Helpful words came to  me.  </p>
          <p class="style17">My disease is making me increasingly  helpless.  When I face the final helplessness  of death, will help come to me?  Have I  got that much faith?</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17"><strong>Possessions</strong></h2>
          <p class="style17">My life is not my life, it doesn’t belong  to me.  It belongs to God.  It came from God in the beginning, and it  returns to God in the end.  It was freely  given to me in the beginning.  I did not  earn it and I do not deserve it.  I can  accept it, but I have no right to keep it.   I cannot possess it: it is not my possession.  It belongs to God and to God it must return.  The same is true of everything.  None of  my possessions belong to me; they belong to God and must return to God in the  end.  In reality I have no possessions,  not even a soul.  This is good news  because it means I have nothing to lose, not even a soul.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17">Good People and Bad People</h2>
          <p class="style17"> It has become clear to me that God has no favourites. In the imagery of Jesus, the Father loves all his
            children equally. The father loves bad children just as much as good children. And so whether I am good or
            bad makes no difference to the father’s love for me. I can never lose it. That love is the unwavering
            constant in an ever changing universe.</p>
          <p class="style17"> When I was a child I believed that I had an immortal soul and that my main purpose in this life was to save
            my soul in the next. This life is brief, the next life is eternal. So what happens in the next life is all important.
            It was clear that in this life bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people. This
            was clearly unfair. So a just God would put things right in the next life. In the next life good things will
            happen to good people, and bad things will happen to bad people. The good will go to their eternal reward
            in heaven and the bad will go to their eternal punishment in hell. The fear of losing my soul in the next life;
            the fear of eternal punishment, was powerful motivation for good behaviour in this life. Without that fear
            there would be no motivation for good behaviour in this life. Anarchy would rule.</p>
          <p class="style17"> I no longer believe that I have an immortal soul, so I have nothing to lose. The fear of losing my soul has lost
            its power over me. The fear of eternal punishment in hell has lost its power over me. When I sense God’s
            love for me deep within my heart, a love I can never lose, then I lose all fear. I no longer fear losing my soul.
            I have already lost my soul – in God.            </p>
          <p class="style17">Richard Dawkins is fond of the quotation: “good people do good things, and bad people do bad things; but
            for good people to do bad things, it takes religion”. I disagree. It does not need religion. We humans are a
            mixture of light and dark. We all have a dark side. Religious people have a dark side; the Holy Father has a
            dark side. Even Richard Dawkins has a dark side. And good people have a dark side. We ignore the dark
            side at our peril. If I can see and accept my dark side, it becomes a powerful ally. If I am blind to my own
            dark side, or reject it, then it appears to be outside me. It appears to be in other people. I see bad people. I
            do bad things to them because they are bad and deserve to be punished. That is what makes good people
            do bad things. They don’t know what they are doing. They think they are punishing bad people, but they
            are really punishing their own dark side. But Jesus tells us to love our enemies, our dark sides. Then they
            become our friends and allies.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17">From Hierarchy to Communion</h2>
          <p class="style17">            When people are afraid, they instinctively form themselves into a hierarchy, both individually and
            communally. The body behaves like an extension of the head; everyone obeys the orders of the leader. If
            the fear persists, the hierarchy becomes stronger and turns into a tyranny of fear. Fear is an unpleasant
            sinking sensation in the gut. Individually I desensitize my gut feeling by going into my head. I look down on
            my body from inside my head. I stop listening to my gut feelings. Hierarchy is a sign of fear; communion is a
            sign of love. In the kingdom there is no hierarchy because the kingdom is a communion of equals. We are
            all children of the same father, and our humble father lowers himself to be equal with us.</p>
          <h2 align="center" class="style17">Heaven and Hell</h2>
          <p class="style17">
            It was a sunny afternoon in May. Philomena and I were sitting together on a bench in the shade of two
            twisted oaks gazing out over the estuary of the Beaulieu River in Hampshire. In the foreground were green
            reeds. Beyond them lay the mud flats riven by channels dug by the receding tide. Beyond was the silver
            ribbon of the river on which leisure boats plied slowly up and down. On the far bank was the woodland of
            the Beaulieu estate with the riverside walk from Beaulieu to Bucklers Hard. To the left in the distance the tip
            of the Needles off the Isle of Wight were just visible. Gazing on that tranquil scene in the company of
            someone I loved I thought if heaven were like this it would be good enough for me; I could happily stay here
            forever. I was glimpsing heaven on earth.</p>
          <p class="style17"> Sometimes life has been like heaven; sometimes life has been like hell. Life often seems like hell on earth
            now. When life is hell on earth, where is heaven? (Where was God in Auschwitz?) That is my challenge
            today. Jesus tells me to look within. Heaven is within me. If I gaze into the depths of my own heart long
            enough for my eyes to adapt accustomed to the dark, I catch glimpses of an answer; I catch glimpses of a
            light, like a star shining in the inner darkness. The mystics tell me that this light is in everyone, and if we
            gathered them all together they would blaze like the face of the sun. The way to the light passes through
            the dark; the way to heaven passes through hell. And so Jesus had to suffer to show us the way to heaven,
            because the way to heaven passes through hell. And Jesus teaches by example.            </p>
          <p class="style17">The inner darkness is where I hide my darkest secrets. This is the inner hell where I confront my inner
            demons. Carl Jung says my worst enemy is within me, and Jesus tells me to love my enemies. To reach the
            heaven within I have to befriend my inner demons. When I befriend my inner demons I love myself as God
            loves me  - completely.</p></td>
